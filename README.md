# Knight-Run

This is a simple game made in pygame. Playing it should remind players of games like
Temple Run and Subway Surfers. It is played by using the arrow keys to pick a lane to dodge enemies that are coming at you. 
The global high score is saved to a database when you play.

# Development Environment

Code was written in VS code.

The whole project is written in Python with the pygame library. 
The database we used was firebase. In order to run the game you need a json file that has the key to the database. We cant 
add the key to github because its a security risk and firebase will automatically change the key.
